# Mango Solutions Shiny workshop for EdinbR

Our June meeting (17th June 2015) was an introductory workshop to [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), the R web application framework. 

This was presented by Chris Campbell of [Mango Solutions](http://www.mango-solutions.com/), a data analysis consultancy and organisers of the [EARL R conferences](http://www.earl-conference.com/).

The workshop consisted of a [presentation](./Introduction to Shiny.pptx) and a few excerises to work through, the code for each excercise is included within separate directories. 

To run the examples, use:

```
shiny::runGitHub("EdinbR/mango-shiny-workshop", subdir="Exercise1")
```

Or clone the repository and look at the code yourself:

```
git clone git://github.com/EdinbR/mango-shiny-workshop
cd mango-shiny-workshop/
```
